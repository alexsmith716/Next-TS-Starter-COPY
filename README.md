## Project Description

***** this a copy/tester version of 'Next-TS-Starter'. it picks up on the last push to 'Next-TS-Starter' *****
***** wanted to push it to GitHub. it is close to completion -needs some additional code & TS typing *****
***** basically, all changes here will be merged into 'Next-TS-Starter' *****
***** No more features/additions are being added. Finishing the code & TS here then done with Next.JS for a while *****

This is my first official try with Next.js. Getting the hang of Next.js and bringing the other tech used in this project up to snuff took weeks longer than I anticipated but things are finally moving faster. The goal of this repo is to become familiar working with Next.js. I want to use Next.js as a platform to build out TypeScript, UI, API, AWS, CI/CD, Testing and basically all other Server/Client skills & technologies. Main focus right now is to get a stable project that I can improve my Testing, TS & Linting abilities. Will be quickly adding more API usage scenarios to the app.

This app is an updated and modified version of React-TS-Starter.

## Technologies Used:
* Next.JS 12.1.5
* TypeScript
* React 18.0.0
* Redux
* Redux Persist
* Next Redux Wrapper
* Axios
* Styled Components
* AWS SDK

## Next.JS Features:
- Custom App Component
- SSR (initial data population & SEO)

## To-do list:
* Too much to list right now
* add in some basic testing -i will start 1-2 new repos soley dedicated to testing
