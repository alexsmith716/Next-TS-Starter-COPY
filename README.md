# Next-TS-Starter-COPY

## Project Description

This is my first try with Next.js. The goal of this repo is to become familiar working with Next.js. I want to use Next.js as a platform to build out TypeScript, UI, API, AWS, CI/CD, Testing and basically all other Server/Client skills & technologies. Main focus right now is to get a stable project that I can improve my Testing, TS and React knowledge.

## Technologies Used:
* Next.JS 12.1.6
* TypeScript
* React 18
* Redux
* Redux Persist
* Next Redux Wrapper
* Axios
* SWR
* AWS SDK
* Styled Components

## Next.JS Features:
- Custom `App` Component
- Custom `Document` Component
- Custom `Head` component
- Custom 404 Error Page
- API Routes
- Basic usage Middleware (`middleware` function)
- Data-Fetching & SSR (`getServerSideProps` and `getInitialProps` -no `getStaticProps` this project)
- React Strict Mode
- Integrated ESLint
- Environment Variables
- Cypress
- Nock

## To-do list:
* More Testing
* Integrate more of Redux Toolkit API
* Go back over TS typing
