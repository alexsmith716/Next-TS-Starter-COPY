# Next-TS-Starter-COPY

## Project Description

***** there seems to be something odd about the API Route on the VERY first load in production mode. It's as if the route is completely ignored. I am referring to `await store.dispatch(loadMetaWeather())` line 30 in '_app.tsx'. Like the route has to be 'primed' and then it will work as expected. The issue does not occur in production at all. I can repeat the behavior over and over. *****

***** this a copy/tester version of 'Next-TS-Starter'. it picks up on the last push to 'Next-TS-Starter' *****
***** wanted to push it to GitHub. it is close to completion -needs some additional code & TS typing *****
***** basically, all changes here will be merged into 'Next-TS-Starter' *****
***** No more features/additions are being added. Finishing the code & TS here then done with Next.JS for a while *****

This is my first official try with Next.js. Getting the hang of Next.js and bringing the other tech used in this project up to snuff took weeks longer than I anticipated but things are finally moving faster. The goal of this repo is to become familiar working with Next.js. I want to use Next.js as a platform to build out TypeScript, UI, API, AWS, CI/CD, Testing and basically all other Server/Client skills & technologies. Main focus right now is to get a stable project that I can improve my Testing, TS & Linting abilities. Will be quickly adding more API usage scenarios to the app.

This app is an updated and modified version of React-TS-Starter.

## Technologies Used:
* Next.JS 12.1.5

## To-do list:
